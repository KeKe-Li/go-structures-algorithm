Go 数据结构和算法,在leetcode上的一些题目的解答.

#### Data Structures

数据结构:是相互之间存在-种或多种特定关系的数据元素的集合。按照视点的不同,我们把数据结构分为逻辑结构和物理结构。

* 逻辑结构

逻辑结构指反映数据元素之间的逻辑关系的数据结构，其中的逻辑关系是指数据元素之间的前后关系，而与他们在计算机中的存储位置无关。

逻辑结构分为以下四类：

1. 集合结构

集合结构中的数据元素同属于一个集合，他们之间是并列的关系，除此之外没有其他关系。

2. 线性结构

线性结构中的元素存在一对一的相互关系。主要包括:数组，栈，队列，链表，哈希表.

3. 树形结构

树形结构中的元素存在一对多的相互关系。主要包括:二叉树，二分搜索树，AVL，红黑树，Treap，Splay，堆，Trie，线段树，K-D树，并查集，哈夫曼树...


4. 图形结构

图形结构中的元素存在多对多的相互关系。主要包括:邻接矩阵，邻接表.

* 物理结构

物理结构:是指数据的逻辑结构在计算机中的存储形式。物理结构又叫存储结构，指数据的逻辑结构在计算机存储空间的存放形式。通俗的讲，物理结构研究的是数据在存储器中存放的形式。 

数据元素的存储结构形式有两种:顺序存储和链式存储。 

1. 顺序存储结构

顺序存储结构:是把数据元素存放在地址连续的存储单元里，其数据间的逻辑关 系和物理关系是一致的.

这种存储结构其实很简单，说白了 ， 就是排队占位。大家都按顺序排好，每个人 占一小段空间，大家谁也别插谁的队。 我们之前学计算机语言时，数组就是这样的顺 序存储结构。

2. 链式存储结构

链式存储结构:是把数据元素存放在任意的存储单元里，这组存储单元可以是连 续的，也可以是不连续的.

数据元素的存储关系并不能反映其逻辑关系，因此需要用 一个指针存放数据元素的地址，这样通过地址就可以找到相关联数据元素的位置.

显然，链式存储就灵活多了，数据存在哪里不重要，只要有一个指针存放了相应的地址就能找到白了 。

数据结构类型:

* [Bitarray](https://github.com/KeKe-Li/go-structures-algorithm/blob/feature-keke/src/structures/bitarray/bitarray.go)
* [Queue](https://github.com/KeKe-Li/go-structures-algorithm/blob/feature-keke/src/structures/queue/queue.go)
* [Fibonacci Heap](https://github.com/KeKe-Li/go-structures-algorithm/blob/feature-keke/src/structures/fibheap/fibheap.go)
* [Range Tree](https://github.com/KeKe-Li/go-structures-algorithm/blob/feature-keke/src/structures/rangetree/interface.go)
* [AVL Tree]()
* [hashmap](https://github.com/KeKe-Li/go-structures-algorithm/blob/feature-keke/src/structures/hashmap/fastinteger/hashmap.go)
* [Skiplist](https://github.com/KeKe-Li/go-structures-algorithm/blob/feature-keke/src/structures/skiplist/skiplist.go)
* [B+ Tree]()
* [Immutable B Tree]()


* 跳跃表 (Skiplist)

增加了向前指针的链表叫作跳表。跳表全称叫做跳跃表，简称跳表。跳表是一个随机化的数据结构，实质就是一种可以进行二分查找的有序链表。
跳表在原有的有序链表上面增加了多级索引，通过索引来实现快速查找。跳表不仅能提高搜索性能，同时也可以提高插入和删除操作的性能。
采用redis底层类似的实现，在每层上增加了偏移量的记录，好处是在按排行取元素的时候可以先从上层按偏移量快速定位到目标位置，不需要在底层链表进行遍历定位。
